------------

To get a copy of the repository you can download the source from [http://github.com/drwoohoo/ExtendScripts_AI](http://github.com/drwoohoo/ExtendScripts_AI/) or, alternatively, you can use git clone:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/drwoohoo/ExtendScripts_AI.git
</pre>

Copy the `Dr Woohoo` folder into the Adobe Illustrator/Presets/Scripts folder, restart Illustrator if it's open and the script will appear in the File > Scripts submenu. Depending on what version of Illustrator you have, the Scripts folder might be located within a localized folder, e.g., en_US/Scripts.


How to Edit An ExtendScript
---------------------------

You will find that most of these scripts were created for handling a specific challenge at the time. If you would like to extend them yourself, you can via Adobe's ExtendScript Toolkit, which is included with all installations of the Creative Suite.
